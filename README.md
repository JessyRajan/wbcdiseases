                    Leukemia Detection using WBC count


The usage of Image processing techniques for identification and counting of
cells of interest opens a wide plethora of applications for early detection of vast
number of ailments. Analysis of human blood samples provides data that can be used
to detect and predict many diseases, which can be treated successfully if diagnosed
early. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is one such disorder mostly affecting children
of age less than 5 years and adults greater than 50 years . Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) is caused due to the over production of immature white blood cells
called lymphoblasts (also known as blast cells), which inhibit the production of
normal white blood cells (WBCs). The term acute means ALL can progress at an
alarming rate to other parts of the body like central nervous system, spleen, liver and
lymph nodes and if left untreated it can pose danger to life in a few months. This
makes early detection of the disease of paramount importance to prevent further
damage to the body. Presence of lymphoblasts in a blood sample is a sure way of
knowing if the patient is tested positive for the disease. This paper presents a
method to automatically identify and count the lymphoblast cells in a given blood
sample, so as to eliminate human errors and most importantly facilitate earlier
detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.


The proposed system is to to develop a computer-aided technique, which can
predict whether the person is affected by analyzing the blood samples. Early detec-
tion of cancer is extremely important in ensuring the patients chance of survival.In
this system the blood samples are collected and the image processing techniques are
applied over it.Then cell classification is done inorder to detect whether the sample
provided is an infected one or not.
